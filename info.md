# Electricity Planner – Project Summary

**Version 5.0.0** | **Config Schema Version 20** | **Home Assistant 2024.4+**

A Home Assistant custom integration that analyses live Nord Pool prices, battery SOC, and solar production to recommend when you should charge from the grid. It never controls hardware directly—instead it exposes boolean decisions, grid power limits, and human-readable reasons that you wire into your own automations.

> Release note for v5.0.0: consolidated 5.x release that ships the car-state-aware solar allocation policy (`_allocate_solar_power` reserves a fixed `significant_solar_threshold` slice for batteries when the car is actively charging, and routes surplus fully to batteries when the car is idle), the solar-only bootstrap path (`_bootstrap_car_solar_allocation` offers leftover surplus to an idle car when batteries are full or within `soc_buffer` of `max_soc_threshold`), and `_calculate_charger_limit` using `solar_headroom = allocated_car_solar + remaining_solar` across all grid-charging branches so the EV's limit includes exportable surplus on top of the grid allowance. Peak-import protection preserves the full non-grid portion via `non_grid_floor`, and reason strings go through a shared `_format_power_sources` helper for consistency.

## Key Features

- **Multi-battery support** with capacity-weighted SOC averaging and per-battery configuration
- **Separate decisions** for home batteries and electric vehicles with distinct logic
- **Six charging strategies** in priority order: Solar Priority, Predictive, Very Low Price, SOC Buffer, Dynamic Price, SOC-Based
- **Three-phase support** for installations with phase-specific batteries or inverters
- **Dynamic threshold mode** with volatility-aware confidence scoring
- **24-hour average threshold** using rolling Nord Pool price data
- **SOC-based price relaxation** that accepts higher prices when battery is critically low
- **Car charging hysteresis** with minimum window validation and threshold floor pattern
- **Sunny-day dual SOC limits** with forecast-based kWh trigger and today/tomorrow forecast handling
- **Permissive mode switch** for temporarily relaxed car charging thresholds
- **Manual override services** to force or block charging for configurable durations
- **Contract-specific pricing** with multiplier/offset adjustments for consumption and feed-in
- **Arbitrage mode** with threshold-based export activation and dashboard threshold visibility
- **Comprehensive diagnostics** with 20 sensors and 7 binary sensors
