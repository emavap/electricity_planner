A Home Assistant integration that provides intelligent electricity usage planning decisions, specifically designed for Belgian electricity markets. The integration analyzes battery status, solar forecasts, and electricity prices to provide **boolean recommendations** for when to charge batteries and cars from the grid. **Power control is handled by external systems.**

## ‚ú® Features

### üîã Multi-Battery Support
- **Any battery system** with SOC and capacity sensors
- Multiple battery monitoring simultaneously
- Brand-independent - works with any Home Assistant battery integration

### ‚ö° Smart Grid Charging Decisions
- **Price-threshold based** - Only recommends grid charging when rates are below threshold
- **Solar-aware decisions** that prefer solar over grid power
- **Simple boolean outputs** - True only when grid charging is economically favorable
- **No emergency overrides** - External systems handle emergency situations
- **Rate-focused logic** - Returns False (0) when rates are too high

### üöó Car Grid Charging Recommendations
- **Intelligent scheduling** recommendations during low-price periods
- **Solar preference** - avoids grid charging when solar is available
- **Battery priority** ensures home batteries are maintained first
- **Time-based logic** for optimal night charging

### üåû Solar Optimization
- **Real-time production monitoring**
- **Weather-based solar forecasting**
- **Grid feed-in optimization** to minimize unnecessary charging

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Entity-Based Configuration**: Select any compatible entities during setup
2. **Decision Engine**: Multi-factor algorithm for optimal grid charging decisions  
3. **Coordinator**: Real-time data coordination and state management
4. **Boolean Outputs**: Binary sensors indicating when to charge from grid

### Decision Algorithm Flow
```
Price Analysis + Battery Status + Solar Forecast ‚Üí Grid Charging Decisions
```

The algorithm uses **comprehensive Nord Pool data** and provides **two key boolean outputs**:
- **`binary_sensor.battery_grid_charging`** - True when batteries should be charged from grid
- **`binary_sensor.car_grid_charging`** - True when car should be charged from grid

Decision factors:
- **Nord Pool pricing**: Current vs. highest/lowest prices, next hour trends
- **Price positioning**: Where current price sits in daily range (0-100%)
- **Battery status**: SOC levels, total capacity, remaining capacity needs
- **Power flow**: House consumption, solar surplus, car charging power
- **Smart logic**: Very low prices (bottom 30%), price trend improvements
- **Solar preference**: Uses solar surplus instead of grid when available

## üîÑ Decision Sequences & Logic

### Battery Grid Charging Decision Sequence

The integration evaluates battery grid charging in this specific order:

1. **üîã Battery Status Check**
   ```
   ‚ùå No batteries configured ‚Üí FALSE
   ‚ùå Batteries full (>90% SOC) ‚Üí FALSE
   ‚úÖ Continue to price analysis
   ```

2. **üí∞ Price Threshold Check**
   ```
   ‚ùå Price above threshold ‚Üí FALSE ("Price too high")
   ‚úÖ Price below threshold ‚Üí Continue
   ```

3. **‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Surplus Check**
   ```
   ‚ùå Significant solar surplus (>1kW) ‚Üí FALSE ("Use solar instead")
   ‚úÖ No/low solar surplus ‚Üí Continue
   ```

4. **üìä Smart Price Analysis**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Very low price (bottom 30% of daily range) ‚Üí TRUE
   ‚úÖ Price improving next hour + capacity needed (>20%) ‚Üí TRUE
   ‚ùå Otherwise ‚Üí FALSE ("Price OK but not optimal")
   ```

### Car Grid Charging Decision Sequence

The integration evaluates car grid charging in this specific order:

1. **üí∞ Price Threshold Check**
   ```
   ‚ùå Price above threshold ‚Üí FALSE ("Price too high")
   ‚úÖ Price below threshold ‚Üí Continue
   ```

2. **üìä Price-Only Analysis**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Very low price (bottom 30% daily range) ‚Üí TRUE
   ‚úÖ Price improving next hour ‚Üí TRUE ("Charge now")
   ‚úÖ Any low price (below threshold) ‚Üí TRUE
   ‚ùå Otherwise ‚Üí FALSE ("Price not favorable")
   ```

**Note**: Car charging is purely price-based. Solar surplus is not considered as it's typically insufficient for car charging needs.

## üìà Price Analysis Logic

### Price Positioning Calculation
```python
price_position = (current_price - lowest_price) / (highest_price - lowest_price)
# Result: 0.0 = lowest price of day, 1.0 = highest price of day
```

### Classification System
- **Very Low Price**: Position < 0.3 (bottom 30% of daily range)
- **Low Price**: Below user threshold (default 0.15 ‚Ç¨/kWh)
- **Price Improving**: Next hour price < current price
- **Price Worsening**: Next hour price > current price

### Decision Priority

#### Battery Charging:
1. **üö´ Hard Stop**: Price above threshold ‚Üí Always FALSE
2. **üåû Solar First**: Use available solar surplus before grid
3. **üíé Very Low Prices**: Bottom 30% of daily range ‚Üí TRUE
4. **üìà Trend Analysis**: Price improving next hour + capacity needed ‚Üí TRUE
5. **üìä Position-based**: Reject if price position not optimal

#### Car Charging:
1. **üö´ Hard Stop**: Price above threshold ‚Üí Always FALSE
2. **üíé Very Low Prices**: Bottom 30% of daily range ‚Üí TRUE
3. **üìà Trend Analysis**: Price improving next hour ‚Üí TRUE
4. **üí∞ Low Price**: Any price below threshold ‚Üí TRUE

## üîÑ Real-time Updates

The integration updates every **5 minutes** and immediately when any tracked entity changes:

- **Nord Pool prices** (current, highest, lowest, next)
- **Battery SOC and capacity** values
- **House consumption** changes
- **Solar surplus** changes
- **Car charging power** changes

Each update triggers a complete re-evaluation of both battery and car charging recommendations.

## üáßüá™ Belgium Specific Features

This integration is optimized for the Belgian electricity market:
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Compatible with variable electricity pricing
- **Solar Feed-in**: Considers Belgian feed-in tariff structures
- **Peak Shaving**: Reduces consumption during high-price periods
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Follows Belgian residential battery storage guidelines

## üîó Compatibility

### Electricity Price Sources
- **[Nord Pool](https://github.com/custom-components/nordpool) integration** (recommended)
  - Provides current, highest, lowest, and next hour prices
  - Essential for comprehensive price analysis and positioning
- Any integration providing the 4 required price entities in ‚Ç¨/kWh

### Battery Systems
- **Any battery system** providing SOC (%) and capacity (kWh) sensors
- Examples: Huawei Luna, Victron, Tesla Powerwall, LG Chem, BYD, etc.
- Works with any Home Assistant battery integration

### Solar Systems
- Huawei Solar inverters
- SolarEdge systems
- Any system providing production sensors

### External Charging Control Systems
- Any battery management system with HA integration
- Car chargers with Home Assistant switch entities
- Custom charging controllers via automations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Binary sensors always False**: Check that electricity price is below your configured threshold and verify all required Nord Pool entities are configured
2. **Missing Nord Pool data**: Ensure all 4 price entities (current, highest, lowest, next) are available and providing numeric data
3. **Power flow issues**: Verify house consumption and solar surplus entities are providing valid data in Watts
4. **Battery analysis errors**: Check that battery SOC and capacity entities are configured and providing numeric data
5. **Unexpected recommendations**: Integration uses comprehensive price positioning - check price analysis sensor for detailed reasoning

### Debug Logging
Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.electricity_planner: debug
```
