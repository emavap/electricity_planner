## üîß Automation Examples

### Emergency Battery Charging
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Emergency Battery Charging Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.electricity_planner_battery_needs_charging
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_device
        data:
          title: "Battery Alert"
          message: "Emergency charging activated - battery below {{ states('sensor.electricity_planner_battery_analysis') }}%"
```

### Automatic Car Charging
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Auto Car Charging"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.electricity_planner_car_charging_recommended
        to: "on"
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: switch.electricity_planner_auto_charging_mode
        state: "on"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        entity_id: switch.electricity_planner_car_charger_control
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_device
        data:
          message: "Car charging started - {{ state_attr('binary_sensor.electricity_planner_car_charging_recommended', 'reason') }}"
```

## üáßüá™ Belgium Specific Features
