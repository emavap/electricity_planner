## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Entity-Based Configuration**: Select any compatible entities during setup
2. **Decision Engine**: Multi-factor algorithm for optimal grid charging decisions  
3. **Coordinator**: Real-time data coordination and state management
4. **Boolean Outputs**: Binary sensors indicating when to charge from grid

### Decision Algorithm Flow
```
Price Analysis + Battery Status + Solar Forecast ‚Üí Grid Charging Decisions
```

The algorithm uses **comprehensive Nord Pool data** and provides **two key boolean outputs**:
- **`binary_sensor.battery_grid_charging`** - True when batteries should be charged from grid
- **`binary_sensor.car_grid_charging`** - True when car should be charged from grid

Decision factors:
- **Nord Pool pricing**: Current vs. highest/lowest prices, next hour trends
- **Price positioning**: Where current price sits in daily range (0-100%)
- **Battery status**: SOC levels, total capacity, remaining capacity needs
- **Power flow**: House consumption, solar surplus, car charging power
- **Smart logic**: Very low prices (bottom 30%), price trend improvements
- **Solar preference**: Uses solar surplus instead of grid when available

### üåû Solar Forecast Analysis

The integration supports dedicated solar forecast entities for accurate production prediction:

#### Forecast Entity Priority

1. **Best**: Tomorrow + Today comparison
   ```python
   solar_production_factor = min(1.0, forecast_tomorrow / forecast_today)
   ```

2. **Good**: Remaining today forecast  
   ```python
   solar_production_factor = min(1.0, forecast_remaining_today / 5.0)  # 5kWh typical daily minimum
   ```

3. **Basic**: Hourly forecasts
   ```python
   solar_production_factor = min(1.0, max(current_hour, next_hour) / 2.0)  # 2kWh/hour good production
   ```

4. **Fallback**: Safe default (50% solar factor) when no entities configured

#### Solar Production Categories
- **Excellent**: Solar factor > 80% - Skip charging, wait for solar
- **Good**: Solar factor > 60% - Moderate charging decisions
- **Moderate**: Solar factor > 30% - Normal charging logic  
- **Poor**: Solar factor ‚â§ 30% - Prefer grid charging when cheap

## üß† Decision Logic Documentation

### Overview

The Electricity Planner uses a hierarchical decision engine that evaluates multiple factors to make intelligent charging recommendations. All decisions are boolean outputs (charge/don't charge) with detailed reasoning provided for validation.

### Core Decision Flow

```
1. Data Validation ‚Üí 2. Power Allocation ‚Üí 3. Decision Logic ‚Üí 4. Safety Validation ‚Üí 5. Output Generation
```

## üìä Power Allocation Logic

### Solar Power Allocation (Hierarchical Priority)

```python
Available Solar Surplus = Solar Production - House Consumption
```

**Priority Order:**
1. **Current Car Consumption** (if car is charging > min_car_charging_threshold)
2. **Battery Charging** (if SOC < max_soc_threshold AND not batteries_full)
3. **Additional Car Charging** (if average_soc >= max_soc_threshold - 10%)
4. **Remaining Solar** (available for export or curtailment)

**Safety Limits Applied:**
- Battery allocation: `min(available_solar, max_battery_power, significant_solar_threshold)`
- Car allocation: `min(available_solar, max_car_power)`
- Total validation: `total_allocated <= solar_surplus` (with emergency correction if exceeded)

## üîã Battery Charging Decision Logic

### Decision Hierarchy (Evaluated in Order)

#### 1. **EMERGENCY CHARGING** (Highest Priority)
```python
if average_soc < emergency_soc_threshold:
    return CHARGE  # Override all other logic
```

#### 2. **SOLAR PRIORITY** 
```python
if solar_for_batteries > 0:
    return NO_GRID_CHARGE  # Use solar instead
```

#### 3. **VERY LOW PRICE** 
```python
if price_position <= (very_low_price_threshold / 100):
    return CHARGE  # Bottom X% of daily price range
```

#### 4. **PREDICTIVE CHARGING**
```python
if is_low_price AND significant_price_drop AND average_soc > predictive_charging_min_soc:
    return NO_CHARGE  # Wait for better price
```

#### 5. **SOLAR PEAK AWARENESS**
```python
if is_solar_peak AND average_soc > 30 AND solar_forecast_factor > 0.6:
    if average_soc < solar_peak_emergency_soc:
        return CHARGE  # Emergency override
    return NO_CHARGE  # Wait for solar
```

#### 6. **SOC-BASED CHARGING** (During Low Price Periods)

**Critical Low:** `average_soc < 30%` ‚Üí **ALWAYS CHARGE**
**Low + Poor Forecast:** `30% ‚â§ SOC < 40% AND solar_forecast < poor_solar_forecast_threshold` ‚Üí **CHARGE**
**Medium + Excellent Forecast:** `30% ‚â§ SOC ‚â§ 60% AND solar_forecast > excellent_solar_forecast_threshold` ‚Üí **NO CHARGE**
**Medium:** `SOC < 50%` ‚Üí **CHARGE**

## üöó Car Charging Decision Logic

### Decision Hierarchy

#### 1. **Solar-Only Charging**
```python
if solar_for_car > 0:
    return CHARGE_WITH_SOLAR  # Use allocated solar power
```

#### 2. **Predictive Price Logic**
```python
if is_low_price AND significant_price_drop:
    return NO_CHARGE  # Wait for better price
```

#### 3. **Very Low Price**
```python
if very_low_price:
    return CHARGE  # Bottom X% of daily range
```

#### 4. **Price Improvement Check**
```python
if next_price < current_price:
    return NO_CHARGE  # Wait for better price
```

#### 5. **Standard Low Price**
```python
if is_low_price:
    return CHARGE
```

## ‚ö° Power Output Calculations

### Charger Limit Logic

```python
if car_not_charging:
    return 0

# NEW: Car charging restriction logic
if not car_grid_charging:
    return 1400  # 1.4kW limit when charging not allowed

if car_solar_only AND solar_for_car > 0:
    return min(solar_for_car, max_car_power)

if average_soc < max_soc_threshold:
    # Car gets grid setpoint, surplus goes to batteries
    return min(max_grid_setpoint, max_car_power)
else:
    # Car can use solar surplus + grid setpoint
    return min(solar_surplus + max_grid_setpoint, max_car_power)
```

### Grid Setpoint Logic

```python
max_grid_setpoint = min(monthly_grid_peak * 0.9, max_grid_power) if monthly_grid_peak > 2500 else 2500

# NEW: Unified calculation based on actual charging needs
car_grid_need = 0
if car_charging AND car_grid_charging:
    car_available_solar = allocated_solar_for_car + car_current_solar_usage
    car_grid_need = max(0, car_charging_power - car_available_solar)
    car_grid_need = min(car_grid_need, max_grid_setpoint)

battery_grid_need = 0
if battery_grid_charging:
    remaining_capacity = max(0, max_grid_setpoint - car_grid_need)
    battery_grid_need = min(remaining_capacity, max_battery_power)

return min(car_grid_need + battery_grid_need, max_grid_setpoint, max_grid_power)
```

## üåû Solar Feed-in Logic

```python
if remaining_solar <= 0:
    return NO_FEEDIN

if current_price >= feedin_price_threshold:
    return ENABLE_FEEDIN
else:
    return DISABLE_FEEDIN  # Keep surplus local
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Car Charging Restrictions

When `binary_sensor.electricity_planner_car_grid_charging` is **False** (charging not allowed):
- **Charger Limit**: Fixed at 1.4kW maximum (prevents high-power charging)
- **Grid Power for Car**: 0W (no grid power allocated to car)
- **Battery Independence**: Battery charging operates independently and unaffected by car restrictions

## üîç Decision Validation

### Using the Diagnostics Sensor

The integration provides a comprehensive `Decision Diagnostics` sensor that exposes all decision parameters:

```yaml
# Example attributes available for validation
sensor.electricity_planner_decision_diagnostics:
  state: "charging_battery"
  attributes:
    decisions:
      battery_grid_charging: true
      battery_reason: "Low price (‚Ç¨0.12/kWh) - SOC 45% < 50% charging"
    power_allocation:
      solar_for_batteries: 0
      total_allocated: 150
      allocation_reason: "Car using 150W, 0W to batteries..."
    validation_flags:
      price_data_valid: true
      power_allocation_valid: true
      emergency_override_active: false
    configured_limits:
      max_battery_power: 3000
      emergency_soc_override: 25
```

### Validation Checklist

**Price Validation:**
- ‚úÖ `price_data_valid = true`
- ‚úÖ `current_price` matches external Nord Pool data
- ‚úÖ `price_position` calculation: `(current - lowest) / (highest - lowest)`

**Power Allocation Validation:**
- ‚úÖ `power_allocation_valid = true` (total_allocated ‚â§ solar_surplus)
- ‚úÖ `solar_for_batteries` + `solar_for_car` + `car_current_solar_usage` = `total_allocated`
- ‚úÖ Individual allocations respect configured limits

**SOC Logic Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Emergency overrides activate below configured thresholds
- ‚úÖ Predictive logic only applies above `predictive_charging_min_soc`
- ‚úÖ Time-aware logic respects season and time contexts

**Safety Validation:**
- ‚úÖ `charger_limit` ‚â§ `max_car_power`
- ‚úÖ `grid_setpoint` ‚â§ `max_grid_power`
- ‚úÖ Battery allocation ‚â§ `max_battery_power`

## üìà Time Context Logic

**Time Periods Defined:**
- **Night**: 22:00 - 06:00 (off-peak grid rates)
- **Early Morning**: 06:00 - 09:00 (pre-solar period)
- **Solar Peak**: 10:00 - 16:00 (maximum solar production, used for solar peak emergency logic)
- **Evening**: 17:00 - 21:00 (peak consumption period)

**Note**: Time context is tracked for diagnostic purposes. The only active time-based logic is **Solar Peak Emergency SOC** which prevents charging during peak solar hours unless SOC is critically low.

## üîß Configuration Through Home Assistant UI

The integration provides a comprehensive configuration flow:

1. **Entity Selection**: Configure Nord Pool, battery, solar, and car entities
2. **Basic Thresholds**: Set SOC limits, price thresholds, and solar parameters
3. **Safety Limits**: Configure power limits and emergency overrides

All parameters are reconfigurable through Home Assistant's integration options without restarting the integration.

## üéØ Decision Examples

### Emergency Charging Examples

#### True Emergency Charging
```
Conditions: SOC 10%, Price high (‚Ç¨0.25/kWh)
Normal Logic: Don't charge (price too high)
Emergency Override: SOC 10% < 15% (emergency_soc_threshold) ‚Üí CHARGE
Reason: "Emergency charging - SOC below critical threshold"
```

#### Solar Peak Conservation
```
Conditions: 12:00 PM, SOC 35%, Low price, Excellent solar forecast (85%)
Solar Peak Logic: Normally wait for solar
Decision: SOC 35% > 25% (solar_peak_emergency_soc) ‚Üí NO CHARGE, wait for solar
Reason: "Solar peak hours - SOC sufficient, awaiting solar production (forecast: 85%)"
```

#### Solar Peak Emergency Override
```
Conditions: 12:00 PM, SOC 20%, Excellent solar forecast (85%)
Solar Peak Logic: Normally wait for solar
Emergency Override: SOC 20% < 25% (solar_peak_emergency_soc) ‚Üí CHARGE
Reason: "Solar peak emergency - SOC too low to wait for solar production"
```

### Power Allocation Examples

#### Solar Power Allocation
```
Available Solar: 2500W
Car Drawing: 3000W
Allocation: Car current usage: 2500W, Batteries: 0W, Car additional: 0W, Remaining: 0W
Validation: total_allocated (2500W) ‚â§ solar_surplus (2500W) ‚úÖ
```

#### Safety Limits Applied
```
Solar Surplus: 15000W (unusual spike)
Max Battery Power: 5000W (user configured)
Max Car Power: 7000W (user configured)
Allocation: Batteries: 5000W, Car: 7000W, Remaining: 3000W
Safety: All allocations respect configured limits
```

### Car Charging Restriction Example

```
Conditions: High price period, car charging not allowed
Car Drawing: 5000W (actual consumption)
Car Grid Charging: False (not allowed due to high price)
Battery Grid Charging: True (battery still allowed)

Outputs:
  Charger Limit: 1400W (1.4kW restriction)
  Grid Setpoint: 3000W (battery power only, 0W for car)
  Reason: "Car charging not allowed - grid power only for battery charging"
```

## üìà Price Analysis Logic

### Price Positioning Calculation
```python
price_position = (current_price - lowest_price) / (highest_price - lowest_price)
# Result: 0.0 = lowest price of day, 1.0 = highest price of day
```

### Classification System
- **Very Low Price**: Position < 0.3 (bottom 30% of daily range)
- **Low Price**: Below user threshold (default 0.15 ‚Ç¨/kWh)
- **Price Improving**: Next hour price < current price
- **Price Worsening**: Next hour price > current price

### Decision Priority

#### Battery Charging:
1. **üö´ Hard Stop**: Price above threshold ‚Üí Always FALSE
2. **üåû Solar First**: Use available solar surplus before grid
3. **üíé Very Low Prices**: Bottom 30% of daily range ‚Üí TRUE
4. **üîã SOC Check**: Batteries >30% + not very low price ‚Üí FALSE
5. **üìä Position-based**: Reject if price position not optimal

#### Car Charging:
1. **üö´ Hard Stop**: Price above threshold ‚Üí Always FALSE
2. **üíé Very Low Prices**: Bottom 30% of daily range ‚Üí TRUE
3. **‚è∞ Wait for Better**: Price improving next hour ‚Üí FALSE (wait)
4. **üí∞ Low Price**: Any price below threshold ‚Üí TRUE

## üîÑ Real-time Updates

The integration updates every **30 seconds** and immediately when any tracked entity changes:

- **Nord Pool prices** (current, highest, lowest, next)
- **Battery SOC and capacity** values
- **House consumption** changes
- **Solar surplus** changes
- **Car charging power** changes

Each update triggers a complete re-evaluation of both battery and car charging recommendations.

## üåç Universal Compatibility Features

This integration is optimized for dynamic electricity markets:
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Compatible with variable electricity pricing (Nord Pool and similar markets)
- **Solar Feed-in**: Considers feed-in tariff structures and export optimization
- **Peak Shaving**: Reduces consumption during high-price periods
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Configurable safety limits for residential battery storage

## üîó Compatibility

### Electricity Price Sources
- **[Nord Pool](https://github.com/custom-components/nordpool) integration** (recommended)
  - Provides current, highest, lowest, and next hour prices
  - Essential for comprehensive price analysis and positioning
- Any integration providing the 4 required price entities in ‚Ç¨/kWh

### Battery Systems
- **Any battery system** providing SOC (%) and capacity (kWh) sensors
- Examples: Huawei Luna, Victron, Tesla Powerwall, LG Chem, BYD, etc.
- Works with any Home Assistant battery integration

### Solar Systems
- Huawei Solar inverters
- SolarEdge systems
- Any system providing production sensors

### External Charging Control Systems
- Any battery management system with HA integration
- Car chargers with Home Assistant switch entities
- Custom charging controllers via automations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Binary sensors always False**: Check that electricity price is below your configured threshold and verify all required Nord Pool entities are configured
2. **Missing Nord Pool data**: Ensure all 4 price entities (current, highest, lowest, next) are available and providing numeric data
3. **Power flow issues**: Verify house consumption and solar surplus entities are providing valid data in Watts
4. **Battery analysis errors**: Check that battery SOC and capacity entities are configured and providing numeric data
5. **Unexpected recommendations**: Integration uses comprehensive price positioning - check price analysis sensor for detailed reasoning

### Debug Logging
Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.electricity_planner: debug
```
