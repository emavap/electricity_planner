A Home Assistant integration that provides intelligent electricity usage planning decisions, specifically designed for Belgian electricity markets. The integration analyzes battery status, solar forecasts, and electricity prices to provide **boolean recommendations** for when to charge batteries and cars from the grid. **Power control is handled by external systems.**

## ‚ú® Features

### üîã Multi-Battery Support
- **Huawei Luna** and **Victron** battery systems
- Multiple battery monitoring simultaneously
- Configurable SOC thresholds per setup

### ‚ö° Smart Grid Charging Decisions
- **Price-threshold based** - Only recommends grid charging when rates are below threshold
- **Solar-aware decisions** that prefer solar over grid power
- **Simple boolean outputs** - True only when grid charging is economically favorable
- **No emergency overrides** - External systems handle emergency situations
- **Rate-focused logic** - Returns False (0) when rates are too high

### üöó Car Grid Charging Recommendations
- **Intelligent scheduling** recommendations during low-price periods
- **Solar preference** - avoids grid charging when solar is available
- **Battery priority** ensures home batteries are maintained first
- **Time-based logic** for optimal night charging

### üåû Solar Optimization
- **Real-time production monitoring**
- **Weather-based solar forecasting**
- **Grid feed-in optimization** to minimize unnecessary charging

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Entity-Based Configuration**: Select any compatible entities during setup
2. **Decision Engine**: Multi-factor algorithm for optimal grid charging decisions  
3. **Coordinator**: Real-time data coordination and state management
4. **Boolean Outputs**: Binary sensors indicating when to charge from grid

### Decision Algorithm Flow
```
Price Analysis + Battery Status + Solar Forecast ‚Üí Grid Charging Decisions
```

The algorithm provides **two key boolean outputs**:
- **`binary_sensor.battery_grid_charging`** - True when batteries should be charged from grid
- **`binary_sensor.car_grid_charging`** - True when car should be charged from grid

Decision factors:
- Current vs. forecasted electricity prices
- Individual battery SOC levels and capacity
- Solar production forecast and current output
- User-defined thresholds and preferences
- Time-of-day considerations

## üáßüá™ Belgium Specific Features

This integration is optimized for the Belgian electricity market:
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Compatible with variable electricity pricing
- **Solar Feed-in**: Considers Belgian feed-in tariff structures
- **Peak Shaving**: Reduces consumption during high-price periods
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Follows Belgian residential battery storage guidelines

## üîó Compatibility

### Electricity Price Sources
- [Nord Pool](https://github.com/custom-components/nordpool) integration
- [Entsoe-e](https://github.com/JaccoR/hass-entso-e) integration
- Any sensor providing price in ‚Ç¨/kWh

### Battery Systems
- Huawei Luna (via [Huawei Solar](https://github.com/wlcrs/huawei_solar) integration)
- Victron (via [Victron](https://github.com/Marty56/Home-Assistant-Victron) integration)
- Any battery system with SOC sensor

### Solar Systems
- Huawei Solar inverters
- SolarEdge systems
- Any system providing production sensors

### External Charging Control Systems
- Any battery management system with HA integration
- Car chargers with Home Assistant switch entities
- Custom charging controllers via automations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Binary sensors always False**: Check that electricity price is below your configured threshold
2. **No price data**: Verify electricity price entity is providing valid numeric data
3. **Solar data missing**: Ensure solar entities are correctly configured and providing numeric data
4. **Unexpected recommendations**: Verify price threshold setting - integration only recommends grid charging when price is below threshold

### Debug Logging
Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.electricity_planner: debug
```
